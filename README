Recaps 0.6
------------------------------------

This simple program allows you to switch between languages using the mostly-unused CapsLock key instead of the clumsy Alt+Shift combination.

Just press CapsLock and the language will change. You can use Alt-CapsLock if you still need the old CapsLock action - to write a lot of text in capital letters.

If you accidentally typed some text in the wrong layout, Ctrl-Capslock should fix it.

If you have more than two languages installed, you can select the ones you want to cycle through if you right click the application's icon.

Enjoy!
